            <p>
                Hi, my name is Ilias Yeck and I am almost finished with my computer science degree having 2 classes in the fall.
                In the future, I hope to develop an app or even a game as that has always been an aspiration of mine. This year also brought me to
                starting a roofing company with a good friend of mine, and it has been going really well. I love progressing in many different aspects of my life.

            <h2>Fun Fact</h2>
            <p>
                This year I started my own roofing company, and it's going great with us averaging two roofs a week being built.
                This is an entirely new experience for me but it has been awesome and I cannot wait to see where I take it.
